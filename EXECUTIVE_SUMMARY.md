# Executive Summary: ChemDoodle Accessibility Project

## Project Overview
**Objective:** Convert hand-drawn scanned PDF chemistry content to accessible digital format using ChemDoodle Web Components library.

## Current Problem
- ❌ Inaccessible scanned PDFs violate ADA compliance
- ❌ Poor learning experience for students with disabilities  
- ❌ Static content limits engagement and comprehension
- ❌ Legal and institutional risk exposure

## Proposed Solution: ChemDoodle Web Components
- ✅ **Free, open-source library** (GPL licensed)
- ✅ **Full accessibility compliance** (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- ✅ **Interactive learning tools** for enhanced engagement
- ✅ **Professional-quality output** that exceeds current standards

## Key Stakeholder Benefits

### For Institution Leadership
- **Legal Protection:** Eliminates ADA compliance risks
- **Cost Effective:** Free library with minimal implementation costs  
- **Innovation Recognition:** Positions institution as accessibility leader
- **Future-Proof:** Scalable solution for all chemistry content

### For Chemistry Department
- **Professional Content:** High-quality, interactive molecular structures
- **Teaching Enhancement:** Better tools for explaining complex concepts
- **Student Engagement:** Interactive learning increases comprehension
- **Academic Excellence:** Modern, research-grade visualization tools

### For Students
- **Universal Access:** Works with all assistive technologies
- **Better Learning:** Interactive features improve understanding
- **Self-Paced:** Students can explore structures at their own speed
- **Future Skills:** Exposure to professional chemistry software

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept (2-3 weeks)
- Convert 5-10 representative Lewis structure PDFs
- Conduct accessibility testing with disabled students
- Gather chemistry faculty feedback
- Demonstrate cost-effectiveness

### Phase 2: Pilot Program (4-6 weeks) 
- Train 2-3 chemistry faculty members
- Integrate with existing LMS (Canvas/Blackboard)
- Create content creation templates
- Develop student orientation materials

### Phase 3: Department Rollout (Ongoing)
- Convert remaining chemistry content
- Expand to other molecular visualization needs
- Monitor compliance and effectiveness
- Continuous improvement based on data
