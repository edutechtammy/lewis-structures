# Lewis Structures - Accessibility Project

## Project Description

This project is to explore how to convert hand drawn scanned pdf content from a higher ed chemistry department and make it accessible via the ChemDoodle library.

## Overview

Traditional chemistry education materials often include hand-drawn Lewis structures in scanned PDF documents, which are inaccessible to students with visual impairments and other disabilities. This project demonstrates how to use the open-source ChemDoodle Web Components library to create interactive, accessible alternatives.

## Project Goals

- Transform inaccessible scanned PDF Lewis structures into interactive web components
- Create a compelling business case for chemistry department stakeholders  
- Demonstrate cost-effective accessibility compliance ($0 vs $2,400+/year alternatives)
- Provide comprehensive screen reader support for molecular structures
- Enable keyboard navigation and universal design principles
- Showcase modern web technologies for chemistry education
- Present clear ROI and implementation roadmap for decision makers

- Professional styling with consistent branding
- Cost-benefit analysis with quantified ROI metrics
- Implementation timeline with clear milestones
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

### **Accessibility Standards Compliance**  
- WCAG 2.1 AA color contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum)
- Proper semantic HTML structure and ARIA markup
- Screen reader compatible molecular descriptions
- Keyboard navigation support throughout
- Mobile-responsive design for universal access

## Usage Instructions

### **Viewing the Presentation**
1. Open `lewis-structures.html` in a web browser
2. Experience the complete stakeholder presentation with:
   - Interactive Lewis structure demonstrations
   - Cost-benefit analysis and ROI calculations
   - Implementation timeline and risk assessment
   - ADA-compliant design throughout

### **Testing Accessibility Features**
1. Use screen reader software to experience the accessible descriptions
2. Navigate using keyboard (Tab, Enter, arrow keys)
3. Test with high contrast mode and zoom levels
4. Verify ARIA labels and semantic structure

### **For Stakeholder Presentations**
1. Navigate through the business case sections
2. Demonstrate the four interactive molecules:
   - Water (H₂O) with lone pairs
   - Methane (CH₄) in tetrahedral geometry
   - Carbon Dioxide (CO₂) with double bonds
   - Ammonia (NH₃) with lone pair
3. Review cost savings and accessibility benefits
4. Present implementation timeline and next steps

## Educational Impact

### For Students with Disabilities
- **Visual impairments**: Complete access to molecular structure information via screen readers
